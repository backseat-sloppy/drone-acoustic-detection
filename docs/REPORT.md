# Project report log

The running record of everything done in this project, in order. It is
append-only: entries are never rewritten. If an entry turns out to be wrong, a
later entry corrects it and refers back.

## Entry template

```
## NNN - Short title
- Date: YYYY-MM-DD
- Type: Data | Preprocessing | Model | Algorithm | Tuning | Evaluation |
        Council | Requirements | Infrastructure | Correction
- Commit: <hash, or "uncommitted">

**What changed.** What was done, concretely.
**Why.** The hypothesis or the reason.
**How.** Commands, files and settings needed to repeat it.
**Result.** Numbers with their conditions: split, sources, class balance,
window, hop. Baselines alongside. "Not run" or "not verified" where true.
**Assessment.** What the result means against REQUIREMENTS.md.
**Next.** The decision taken and the next step.

## 001 - Dataset selection

- Date: 2026-10-09
- Type: Data
- Commit: uncommitted

**What changed.** Public drone-audio datasets were surveyed and four were
selected: DDL (University of Surrey, real recordings only), DroneNoise
(University of Salford), the Halmstad multi-sensor dataset, and FSD50K as a
source of negatives.

**Why.** The pipeline had only been run on synthetic audio from
`src/dad/synth.py`, whose accuracy numbers are meaningless by construction.
Supervised training needs real, labelled recordings. A dataset was accepted
only if it has real rather than synthetic or noise-augmented audio,
documented provenance, per-sample labels or metadata, and a clear licence.
Localisation was ruled out as a goal, so datasets whose value was position
ground truth were dropped.

**How.** Web survey. The accepted and rejected datasets, with reasons, are
listed in `docs/datasets.md`.

**Result.** Four datasets accepted, nine considered and left out. No audio had
been inspected at this point; all properties were taken from the hosts'
descriptions and the papers.

**Assessment.** The known weakness is negatives. DDL has only two noise-only
sessions recorded through the same microphone chain as its drone clips, and
no dataset was recorded with a deployment microphone at a deployment-like
site.

**Next.** Download the four datasets unmodified.

## 002 - Dataset acquisition

- Date: 2026-10-10
- Type: Data
- Commit: uncommitted

**What changed.** The four datasets were downloaded into `data/`, 38.4 GB in
total, and a provenance document was written.

**Why.** To have the raw data available, exactly as published, before any
processing decision is made.

**How.** `scripts/download_datasets.ps1`, which fetches byte ranges over
parallel connections with `curl.exe`, resumes interrupted runs, and gives a
file its final name only after its MD5 matches the checksum published by the
host. The host's API record is saved in each dataset folder as
`_source_record.json`.

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\download_datasets.ps1
```

**Result.**

| Folder | Files | Size | Checksums |
|---|---|---|---|
| `data/DDL_Surrey/` | `MLSP_2022_Real_Data.zip` | 12.63 GB | MD5 verified |
| `data/DroneNoise_Salford/` | 173 WAV, 1 XLSX | 0.74 GB | MD5 verified |
| `data/Halmstad/` | 1 zip | 0.31 GB | MD5 verified |
| `data/FSD50K/` | 11 files (split zip, metadata, labels, docs) | 24.68 GB | MD5 verified |

Nothing was unzipped or modified. The DDL synthesized zip was deliberately
not downloaded. figshare lists 175 DroneNoise entries because one WAV was
uploaded twice with an identical MD5; 174 unique files exist. A copy of
`data/` was also placed on Google Drive, verified by file count and byte
size only.

**Assessment.** The data is in place and its integrity is established. Its
contents are not: sample rates, clip lengths and the Halmstad licence are
still unverified (see "Check before use" in `docs/datasets.md`).

**Next.** Inspect the archives before changing anything, then build a single
manifest across the four sources.

## 003 - Working agreement established

- Date: 2026-10-10
- Type: Infrastructure
- Commit: uncommitted

**What changed.** Added `CLAUDE.md` (the working rules), `REQUIREMENTS.md`
(targets and adjustable settings, owned by Mads), this report log, and a
project-local `council` skill in `.claude/skills/council/`.

**Why.** So the same process applies in every session and on every machine:
every step is logged here, big decisions go through a council review, and
iterations are judged against written requirements.

**How.** See the four files. They are plain text in the repo and travel with
it through git.

**Result.** Not applicable.

**Assessment.** Most values in `REQUIREMENTS.md` are marked PROPOSED: they
are defaults taken from the existing pipeline and from the dataset survey,
not yet confirmed. Deployment hardware and latency targets are open. The
council skill is a new stand-in written for this repo; it is not the
`/council` command used earlier on the other machine, which was not
available here.

**Next.** Mads reviews `REQUIREMENTS.md`. Install the Python toolchain
(`uv`), then step 1 of data preparation: inspect the archives.
